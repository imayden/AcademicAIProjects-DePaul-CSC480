## 3. Usage
❗️Note: this assignment project is implemented with Python3

### 3.1 `Python3` is Required
Make sure that Python3 is installed in your device: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 3.2 Run `IDDFS.py` (Iterative Deepening Depth First Search)
Use command like: python3 src/IDDFS.py data/ctaTrain.json (python3 <filepath> <datapath>) in terminal
```
python3 src/IDDFS.py data/ctaTrain.json
```

### 3.3 Run `BidirectionalSearch.py` (Bidirectional Search)
Use command like: python3 src/BidirectionalSearch.py data/ctaTrain.json (python3 <filepath> <datapath>) in terminal
```
python3 src/BidirectionalSearch.py data/ctaTrain.json
```

### 3.4 Run Iterative Deepening Depth First Search and Bidirectional Search at once
#### 3.4.1 Run `graph.py`
Use command like: python3 src/graph.py data/ctaTrain.json (python3 <filepath> <datapath>)
```
python3 src/graph.py data/ctaTrain.json
```

#### 3.4.2 Run shell script `graph.sh`
Use command like: ./graph.sh data/ctaTrain.json (<filepath> <datapath>)"
```
./graph.sh data/ctaTrain.json
```
